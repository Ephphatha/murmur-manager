This is a simple Sinatra server for exposing a server's tree data as JSON. Run it as you would any Rack-based app.

If you don't want to use Ruby/Sinatra, you can expose a static server interface with any language you want. It just
has to return the following data structure:

	({
		channels: {[
			{ name: "Name", id: ID, parent: PARENT_ID, position: POSITION, state: <temporary|permanent> },
			...
		]},
		users: {[
			{ name: "Name", channel: ID, mute: <true|false>, deaf: <true|false>, online: SECONDS_ONINE, state: <online> },
			...
		]}
	})

You should provide support for the "jsonp" or "callback" URL parameters, and if they are present, prepend them to the JSON
string, so that a JSONP callback is executed when the data is sent from the server.
